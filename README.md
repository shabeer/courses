# Practical Deep Learning for Coders (fast.ai courses)

I have modified(ported) contents of [Practical Deep Learning for Coders](http://course.fast.ai/) to use Keras 2.0.4, python and floyhub. [FloydHub](http://www.floydhub.com/) provides 100 hrs of free GPU computing power for maching learning in the cloud - with lots of cool features.

Floydhub setup is mostly same as referred at [Kaggle Dogs vs. Cats Redux on Floydhub](https://shaoanlu.wordpress.com/2017/04/22/deep-learning-on-floyd-dogs-vs-cats-redux-kaggle-competition/), except for keras 2.0.4 and python 3 version.

These are the lecture materials from [Practical Deep Learning for Coders](http://course.fast.ai/). Two important parts of the course are  [our online forums](http://forums.fast.ai/) and [our wiki](http://wiki.fast.ai/index.php/Main_Page).  If you are encountering an error, we recommend that you first search the forums and wiki for a solution.  If you can't find the answer there, the next step is to ask your question on the forums.  See this advice on [how to ask for help](http://wiki.fast.ai/index.php/How_to_ask_for_Help) in a way that will allow others to most quickly and effectively be able to help you.  Please don't use Github Issues to ask for help debugging (many questions have already been answered in the forums).
